Developed on OSX, but it should compile on Windows, too.  

Usage:
ghci Main.hs AppModel.hs
#The following saves the initial perk list to the same directory that the .hs files are being run from
list
#Now open perkData.txt in a text editor and edit the right-most zeroes into your preferences from 1-5 or 7 for a must-have perk.
#Now run it:
main

It is computationally intensive. Expect it to take several minutes when run from the interpreter. It takes about 15 seconds when run from a compiled binary on my computer.
To compile:
ghc Main.hs -o perkPicker

The compiled file looks for the perkData.txt file in the same directory that the compiled perkPicker program is in.
